$ python ./wordpaths.py /usr/share/dict/words word1 word2

Some example solutions:
rial -> real -> feal -> foal -> foul -> foud
dung -> dunt -> dent -> gent -> geet -> geez
jehu -> jesu -> jest -> gest -> gent -> gena -> guna -> guha
yagi -> yali -> pali -> palp -> paup -> plup -> blup
bitt -> butt -> burt -> bert -> berm -> berm -> germ -> geum -> meum
jina -> pina -> pint -> pent -> peat -> prat -> pray
fike -> fire -> fare -> care -> carp -> camp

The program should take as input the path to the word file, a start word and an end word and print
out at least one path from start to end, or something indicating there is no possible path if
appropriate.
